# **My Java API Project**

## **Introduction**
I have created a budget planner API which intends to calculate the savings from the total income minus the total expenses of a user. Then, my API allows the user to pick a percentage and I have added a range of 10% and 15% that they can apply to their savings. I have researched that it It also reccomends Lloyd's bank's suggestion of the 50-30-20 rule, which is to spend 50% of your total income on needs, 30% on wants and 20% for savings. 


### **How my API works:**

You can build any API of your choosing, but it must include the following:

1. At least one algorithm
1. Unit test at least one class
1. Store the data in a JSON file 
1. Exception handling 
1. Evidence of inheritance
